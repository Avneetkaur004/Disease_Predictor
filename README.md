Identify the purpose, learning outcomes, and skills developed:

Learn machine learning fundamentals and data preprocessing for healthcare datasets
Build, train, and optimize ML models for disease prediction
Demonstrate model evaluation and visualization for portfolio creation


What You Have to Do (Step-by-Step):

Set up the Python ML environment using Google Colab or Replit with Kaggle     datasets (e.g., Heart Disease UCI, Diabetes).
Preprocess  handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale data.
Train ML models (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest) using scikit-learn.
Evaluate models with metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC; visualize results (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve).
